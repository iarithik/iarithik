👋 Hi, I'm [Rithik Rai](https://in.linkedin.com/in/iarithik) (iarithik) - [(Link to CV)](https://flowcv.com/resume/prd61bomfe)

I am a passionate and driven **Quantum Computing Fellow** and **Physics Master's graduate** with a strong foundation in theoretical physics and practical experience in quantum algorithm implementation. My work focuses on bridging the gap between fundamental physics and cutting-edge computational challenges, particularly in optimization and simulation.

### 🔬 Research & Projects Highlights

My expertise is rooted in applying quantum computing to real-world problems, as demonstrated by the following key projects:

*   **[Quantum Approaches to Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP):](https://github.com/Mr-Jamatia/Quantum-Vehicle-Routing-Problems)** Formulated QUBO models and implemented both Full Qubo Solver (FQS) and Average Partitioning Solver (APS) using the D-Wave Ocean SDK. I developed a graph-coarsening pipeline to scale VRP instances, significantly improving solver runtime on large graphs.
*   **[Quantum Walk and Monte Carlo Simulations:](https://github.com/iarithik/Quantum-Walk)** Explored the difference between classical and quantum simulations of the Galton Board. My quantum implementation, which utilizes superposition by not resetting the ancilla qubit, successfully demonstrated interference effects, resulting in a non-classical distribution with peaks at the ends.
*   **[Optimising Battery Temperature for Electric Vehicles:](https://github.com/iarithik/Optimising-Battery-Temperature-for-Electric-Vehicles-Using-Quantum-Annealing)** Used quantum annealing on D-Wave to optimize battery temperature management in lithium-ion EV batteries. This project involved processing NASA battery datasets and formulating the problem as a QUBO model to enhance State of Health (SoH) and extend battery life.
*   **[Quantum Chess:](https://qchess.org/)** Co-developing a quantum-mechanics-inspired variant of chess, based on the mathematical framework proposed in [arXiv:1906.05836](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05836).
